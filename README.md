# Project Description

■ This project is creating a global modification that adds the ability to turn into a dragon and all the content associated with it. Details about the project are in [Wiki](https://github.com/DragonSurvivalTeam/DragonSurvival/wiki). 

■ *I've always liked dragons and this wonderful game, but I've been playing alone and without modifications my whole life, until I accidentally came across this cultural phenomenon in 2020. I was fascinated by the amount of player-created content. There were so many mods created by them, many of which had to do with dragons. You could tame them, breed them, ride them, kill them, but in none of them could you **BE a dragon**. This really upset me. Being an artist very far from programming, modding and the minecraft community, I decided to take a risk and create my own mod. I had absolutely no knowledge or friends in this field. The only thing I had was a dream and the support of a community of dragon lovers. That's about how I became the developer of Dragons Survival. Join us to help develop this project together!*

# Contribution rules

■  I welcome any help and would be very happy if you decided to participate. A few **small rules** to make it easier for us to work and for you not to do the work for nothing. 

* Don't change anything globally and don't do meaningless formatting fixes. The mod works correctly and this is the most important thing. If you plan to add a lot of new content, consult with me before doing so.

* Test everything thoroughly. Separately on the LAN and separately on the Dedicated server. These are not the same thing.  

* Don't touch the skin system. Do not even think about changing it. This is an extremely important part of the mod, which I will not allow to break for the sake of dubious bonuses.

* Try to keep as much compatibility with other mods and flexibility in customization as possible. The more configs that are available, the better! 

* Preferably do not affect the gameplay of human players and do not break the balance. Dragons should be only slightly stronger, not all-powerful.
